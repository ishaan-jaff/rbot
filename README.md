rbot
====

🤖 [rbot](https://github.com/rajivpant/rbot): Rajiv's open source AI augmented brain assistant chatbot currently utilizing OpenAI's GPT and Anthropic's Claude models to offer engaging conversations with a personalized touch and advanced context understanding.

🚀 rbot processes user prompts and custom conversation decorators, enabling more context-aware responses than out-of-the-box ChatGPT Plus with GPT-4.

Custom decorators are a simpler way to achieve outcomes similar to those of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods.

🧠 Custom conversation decorators help the chatbot better understand the context, resulting in more accurate and relevant responses, surpassing the capabilities of out of the box GPT-4 implementations.

A web app for rbot is currently under development. Stay tuned for updates on this project!

Excerpt from the blog post:

### Rbot: Offering Personalized Assistance Beyond ChatGPT Plus, Bing Chat, and Google Bard Currently Offer

As an AI assistant, I provide a unique level of personalization and adaptability that sets me apart from current implementations of ChatGPT Plus, Bing Chat, and Google Bard. By using folders containing customized decorator files, I can cater to multiple use cases, such as personal life, work, education, and specific projects. This customization enables me to understand and support you in a way that is tailored to your unique needs.

#### Serving as Your Personal Life Assistant

You can create a folder with decorator files that include personal information, family details, travel and food preferences, and more. By using this information, I can function as your personal life assistant, offering AI-powered recommendations and support tailored to your specific context.

#### Assisting You in Your Professional Life

Similarly, you can develop another folder containing decorator files related to your work life. These files might include details about your job, industry, colleagues, projects, and other work-related information. With this context, I can help you with various tasks, such as drafting emails, scheduling meetings, conducting research, and more, enhancing your efficiency and organization.

#### Supporting Your Educational Goals

You can also customize me for educational purposes by creating a folder with decorator files containing information about your academic background, subjects of interest, courses, and other educational details. In this role, I can provide personalized educational support, from helping with homework to explaining complex concepts or recommending learning resources.

#### Providing Project-Specific Help

In addition to the use cases mentioned above, I can be tailored to support you on specific projects. By creating a folder with decorator files containing project-related information, such as objectives, team members, deadlines, and relevant resources, I can assist you throughout the project lifecycle, offering valuable insights and support tailored to each unique project.

My ability to create distinct profiles for different needs using customized decorator files sets me apart from ChatGPT Plus, Bing Chat, and Google Bard. This versatility enables me to offer personalized assistance across multiple aspects of your life, ensuring that I can understand and cater to your specific requirements.

### Using decorator files

To use rbot, you can provide conversation decorator files and/or folders containing multiple decorator files. You can view examples of decorator files at <https://github.com/rajivpant/rbot/tree/main/fine-tuning>

Example 1:

```console
rajivpant@RP-2021-MacBook-Pro rbot % ./rbot.py -d fine-tuning/1st-prompt-decorator.md fine-tuning/public/ ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/personal/ ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/hearst -p "Write a short note in Rajiv's voice about Rajiv's job, coworkers, family members, and travel and food preferences for the person temporarily backfilling for his EA." 
Decorators being used:
 - fine-tuning/1st-prompt-decorator.md
 - fine-tuning/public/travel-food.md
 - fine-tuning/public/employment-history.md
 - fine-tuning/public/about.md
 - fine-tuning/public/biography.md
 - ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/personal/accounts.md
 - ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/personal/contact-info.md
 - ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/personal/personal-family.md
 - ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/hearst/hearst.md

```

Example 2:

```console
rajivpant@RP-2021-MacBook-Pro rbot % ./rbot.py -d fine-tuning/1st-prompt-decorator.md fine-tuning/public/ -p "Write a short resume of Rajiv" 
Decorators being used:
 - fine-tuning/1st-prompt-decorator.md
 - fine-tuning/public/travel-food.md
 - fine-tuning/public/employment-history.md
 - fine-tuning/public/about.md
 - fine-tuning/public/biography.md
Using AI engine openai with model gpt-4
[truncated in this example]
```

Example 3:

```console
./rbot.py -p "Tell me a story about a brave knight and a wise wizard." -d decorators/story_characters
```

### Interactive mode

To use rbot in interactive mode, use the `-i` or `--interactive` flag without providing a prompt via command line or input file. In this mode, you can enter follow-up prompts after each response.

Example:

```console
./rbot.py -i -d decorators/story_characters
```

In the first example, rbot generates a short note in Rajiv's voice using the decorator files in the `../rbot-private/fine-tuning` folder. In the second example, rbot provides information on good practices for software development using the `decorators/software_development.txt` decorator file. In the third example, rbot tells a story about a brave knight and a wise wizard using the decorator files in the `decorators/story_characters` folder.

### Using rbot to suggest changes to its own code!

```console
rajivpant@RP-2021-MacBook-Pro rbot % ./rbot.py -d rbot.py -p "if no decorator files are being used, then I want the code to show that."
Decorators being used:
 - rbot.py
Using AI engine openai with model gpt-4
To modify the code to show a message when no decorator files are being used, you can add an else statement after checking for the decorator files. Update the code in the `main()` function as follows:

\```python
if decorator_files:
    print("Decorators being used:")
    for file in decorator_files:
        print(f" - {file}")
else:
    print("No decorator files are being used.")
\```

This will print "No decorator files are being used." when there are no decorator files detected.

### Examples of using with Linux/Unix pipes via the command line

Asking it to guess what some of the decorator files I use are for

```console
rajivpant@RP-2021-MacBook-Pro rbot % find fine-tuning ../rbot-private/fine-tuning -print | ./rbot.py -d fine-tuning/1st-prompt-decorator.md fine-tuning/public/ ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/personal/ ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/hearst/ -p "What do you guess these files are for?" 
Decorators being used:
 - fine-tuning/1st-prompt-decorator.md
 - fine-tuning/public/travel-food.md
 - fine-tuning/public/employment-history.md
 - fine-tuning/public/about.md
 - fine-tuning/public/biography.md
 - ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/personal/accounts.md
 - ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/personal/contact-info.md
 - ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/personal/personal-family.md
 - ../rbot-private/fine-tuning/hearst/hearst.md
Using AI engine openai with model gpt-4
These files appear to be related to the fine-tuning of an AI system, likely for generating text or providing assistance based on the provided information. The files seem to be divided into two categories: public and private.

Public files:
- fine-tuning/public/travel-food.md: Rajiv's travel and food preferences
- fine-tuning/public/employment-history.md: Rajiv's employment history
- fine-tuning/public/about.md: General information about Rajiv
- fine-tuning/public/biography.md: Biography of Rajiv

Private files (stored in a separate private folder):
- fine-tuning/personal/accounts.md: Semi-private personal account information, such as frequent flyer numbers or loyalty programs. Does not contain any confidential or sensitive information.
- fine-tuning/personal/contact-info.md: Personal contact information, such as phone numbers and email addresses. Does not contain any confidential or sensitive information.
- fine-tuning/personal/personal-family.md: Personal and family information, such as family members and relationships. Does not contain any confidential or sensitive information.

Hearst-specific files:
- fine-tuning/hearst/hearst.md: Non-confidential, publicly available information related to the Hearst corporation, including Rajiv's role there

Overall, these files seem to contain various information about a person, their preferences, and professional background, likely used to tailor the AI system's responses and assistance.

Asking technical questions about a project

> ❗️ In the current version of rbot, the --stdin and --prompt options are mutually exclusive, so the following example no longer works as is. In a future update to this README file, I will give an alternate example to obtain the similar results.
```console
alexredmon@ar-macbook ~/s/scribe > cat docker-compose.yml | rbot --stdin -p "which services will be exposed on which ports by running all services in the following docker-compose.yml file?" 
In the given docker-compose.yml file, the following services are exposed on their respective ports:
1. "scribe" service: - Exposed on port 80 - Exposed on port 9009 (mapped to internal port 9009)
2. "scribe-feature" service: - Exposed on port 80
3. "scribe-redis" service: - Exposed on port 6379 (mapped to internal port 6379)
