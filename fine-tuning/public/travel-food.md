# Travel Information for Rajiv Pant

## Airplane Seating Preferences

### In economy class
Rajiv prefers aisle seating.

### In business or first class
Rajiv is fine with either window or aisle seating, as there is sufficient empty space in the legroom area for the window seat passenger to go to the bathroom or to stand up and stretch. He prefers the second, third, or later business-class/first-class rows over the first row, as passengers in the front-most row are not permitted to keep their bags in front of them during takeoff and landing, causing inconvenience.

## Airport Arrival Time
A car ride from Rajiv's apartment to any of the three New York City airports (JFK, EWR, and LGA) can take as long as two hours in bad traffic. To give him one full hour to check-in bags, pass security, and board his flight stress-free, please schedule his departure time for three hours prior to his scheduled flight departure time.

## Preferred flight days
By default, Rajiv prefers to fly on weekends.

# Food Preferences
Rajiv prefers vegetarian, vegan, kosher, halal, or keto food in that order of preference.

## Airline Meals
On airlines, any of the following would be fine for Rajiv: vegetarian, vegan, kosher meal, salmon meal, meal with chicken meat only, meal with turkey meat only, or shrimp/prawn dish.

## Ordering Food for Meetings or Restaurant Bookings
Rajiv prefers eating organic, less-processed food. In seafood, he eats salmon, a few other fishes, shrimp, and prawns. Among meats, he eats chicken, turkey, and organic, grass-fed beef. He prefers organic meats but will also eat regular chicken or turkey meat.

Rajiv avoids eating pork or ham unless there is no other choice. He almost never eats duck, crab, rabbit, deer, or exotic meats.

# The World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders Community
Rajiv is an alumni member of this YGL community from the class of 2014.

## His Participation in the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders Program
Every year, he plans to attend the annual World Economic Forum Young Global Leaders Alumni Summit that happens for about one full week, which is usually in another country. Rajiv's assistant should mark each year’s WEF YGL summit in Rajiv's calendar as out of office. 

Rajiv would also like to attend WEF/YGL events in and around New York as practical. 

His assistant should please ask for access to his informaiton on the WEF Portal TopLink, or him to share his YGL list of events so you can help him attend these.

When Rajiv attends WEF or YGL events (or any conference or edutication program), he prefers to give them his full undivided time and attention. In advance of such events, Rajiv's assistant should please help me make arrangements to temporarily delegate or reschedule his responsibilities at work. 

## Before Travels
Before Rajiv travels, his assistant should remind him to check if he has any family, friends, or World Economic Forum Young Global Leaders (YGL) contacts in the destination cities. Rajiv likes to meet up with them in person when he travels to their cities. He would appreciate if his assistant can give him a reminder at least a week before any trips to create a list of YGL contacts, business contacts, friends and family he can potentially connect with at his travel destinations. Even if he cannot meet them, traveling to their cities serves as a good reminder for Rajiv to reconnect with these people.
