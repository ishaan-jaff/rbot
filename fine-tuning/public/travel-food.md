# Travel Information for Rajiv Pant

## Seating Preferences
### In business or first class:
Rajiv is fine with either window or aisle seating, as there is sufficient empty space in the legroom area for the window seat passenger to go to the bathroom or to stand up and stretch. He prefers the second, third, or later business-class/first-class rows over the first row, as passengers in the front-most row are not permitted to keep their bags in front of them during takeoff and landing, causing inconvenience.

### In economy class:
Rajiv prefers aisle seating.

## Airport Arrival Time
A car ride from Rajiv's apartment to any of the three New York City airports (JFK, EWR, and LGA) can take as long as two hours in bad traffic. To give him one full hour to check-in bags, pass security, and board his flight stress-free, please arrange for his car service pick up three hours prior to his scheduled flight departure time.

## Preferred flight days
By default, Rajiv prefers to fly back home on Fridays and leave NYC on Mondays, unless his son Fitz Raj is with Julie that weekend.

## Before Travels
A week or more before Rajiv travels to any city, he would like his assistant to help make a list of folks from the World Economic Forum Young Global Leader (YGL) community, his business contacts, and his friends and family to connect with. Even if he is not able to meet some (or any) of them, traveling to their city is a good trigger to reconnect with people.

# Food Preferences
To keep it simple: When in doubt, you can order vegetarian, vegan, or kosher food for Rajiv in that order of preference.

## Airline Meals
On airlines, any of the following would be fine for Rajiv: vegetarian, vegan, kosher meal, salmon meal, meal with chicken meat only, meal with turkey meat only, or shrimp/prawn dish.

## Ordering Food for Meetings or Restaurant Bookings
Rajiv prefers eating organic, less-processed food. In seafood, he eats salmon, a few other fishes, shrimp, and prawns. Among meats, he eats chicken, turkey, and organic, grass-fed beef. He prefers organic meats but will also eat regular chicken or turkey meat.

Rajiv avoids eating pork or ham unless there is no other choice. He almost never eats duck, crab, rabbit, deer, or

# The World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders Community
Rajiv is an alumni member of this YGL community.

## His Participation in the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders Program
Every year, he plans attends the annual World Economic Forum Young Global Leaders Alumni Summit that happens for about one full week, which is usually in another country. Rajiv's assistant should mark each year’s WEF YGL summit in Rajiv's calendar as out of office. 

Rajiv would also like to attend as many WEF/YGL events in and around New York as practical. 

His assistant should please ask for access to his informaiton on the WEF Portal TopLink, or him to share his YGL list of events so you can help him attend these.

When Rajiv attends WEF or YGL events, he prefers to give them his full undivided time and attention. In advance of such events, Rajiv's assistant should please help me make arrangements to temporarily delegate or reschedule his responsibilities at work. 

Before Rajiv travels to other cities on business, his assistant should remind me to look up if he has family, friends, and folks from the WEF YGL community in the area. He likes to catch up in person with family, friends, and YGLs when he is in their cities, but often forgets to reach out to them in advance of his trips. If his assitant can remind him before they book his travels, he’d appreciate it.
