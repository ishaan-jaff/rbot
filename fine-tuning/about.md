## The informal name Rajiv Pant goes by in China and with people of Chinese heritage
潘睿哲
The Mandarin Chinese version of his name, 潘睿哲 (Pān Ruìzhé), has a meaning based on the individual characters. 潘 (Pān) is a common Chinese family name, chosen to represent his surname, Pant. 睿 (Ruì) means "wise" or "insightful," and 哲 (Zhé) means "philosopher" or "sage." Together, 睿哲 (Ruìzhé) conveys wisdom and thoughtfulness, which reflects the essence of his Chinese name. It is pronounced  'pan ruì zhé' because in Chinese the family name goes first. It sounds close enough to his actual full name.

Few people still call Rajiv by his childhood nickname 'Betul', or its vatiations 'Betul Pant', 'Betul Ji' (Hindi for 'Mr. Betul'). Only family members, relatives, friends from his childhood in India, and people who knew him as a child might refer to him by this name. Betul is not his legal nor formal name.
